# FT-cheat

### No longer working on current version ###

A userscript for cheating on a dumb online game
If you don't know how to install userscripts, check this page: [http://userscripts-mirror.org/about/installing/]

Only tested on Firefox with the Greasemonkey extension, but it should work on Chrome and Opera.

If you want to explore the source I recommend checking the Git log since most of the code is just deminimified from the game.
